# Graph-Phun-Project
Code to draw and display a simple, adjacency matrix, or adjacency list graph.

Bredth first search still buggy. Works, but not consistently. No depth first search.
Simple graph, adjacency matrix graph, and adjacency list graphs will all draw points.
No edges will be drawn until the search method is selected.
testGraph.java is the main class where the typpe of graph is called.
